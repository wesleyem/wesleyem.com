Welcome to the next installment of my git fundamentals series. If you just landed here and are unsure if you should start here, check out [part one]({% post_url 2023-05-07-intro-to-git-for-beginners %}) where I discuss git in a broader sense.

If you're working on a project with multiple contributors, understanding Git's branching and merging features is essential. In this article, we'll break down the basics of branching and merging and how they help keep projects organized and on track.

## Branching

Branching in Git is the process of creating a separate version of a repository that allows you to work on new features or bug fixes without altering the main codebase. Git creates a new branch by copying the current branch's state, including all changes made up to that point. Each branch can be developed independently, and changes made in one branch do not affect the other branches. This feature allows multiple developers to work on different aspects of a project simultaneously.

To create a new branch in Git, you can use the `git branch` command followed by the name of the new branch. For example, to create a new branch called "new-feature", run the command:

```bash
git branch new-feature
```

To switch to a new branch, use the `git checkout` command followed by the branch name. For example, to switch to the "new-feature" branch, run the command:

```bash
git checkout new-feature
```

You can also create a new branch and switch to it at the same time using the `git checkout` command with the `-b` flag. For example, to create and switch to a new branch called "new-feature", run the command:

```bash
git checkout -b new-feature
```

## Merging

After you have completed work on a branch, you may want to merge your changes back into the main codebase. Merging allows you to combine changes made in different branches into a single branch. This feature enables developers to coordinate their work efficiently and ensure that all changes are incorporated into the final product.

To merge a branch in Git, first switch to the branch you want to merge changes into. For example, to merge changes from the "new-feature" branch into the "master" branch, run the command:

```bash
git checkout master
```

Then, use the `git merge` command followed by the name of the branch you want to merge. For example, to merge changes from the "new-feature" branch, run the command:

```bash
git merge new-feature
```

In some cases, Git may encounter conflicts when merging two branches. A conflict occurs when changes made in one branch conflict with changes made in another branch. In those cases, Git will prompt you to resolve the conflict manually.

Summarily, Git's branching and merging features are essential for collaborating on projects with multiple contributors. Branches allow developers to work independently on separate features and bug fixes, while merging ensures that all changes are incorporated into the final product. By understanding the basics of branching and merging, you will be able to work collaboratively with other developers and manage complex projects efficiently.
