Welcome to part two of this Git series! If you haven't installed Git on your system head over to [part one]({% post_url 2023-05-06-install-git %})

Are you a beginner who wants to learn about version control and how it can help you in your programming projects? Git is one of the most popular version control systems available today. In this article, we'll introduce you to Git and show you how to get started with version control using Git.

## What is Version Control?

Version control is the process of managing changes to code or other files. It helps developers keep track of different versions of their code, collaborate with others on the same project, and revert to previous versions if necessary. Version control is an essential tool for any software development project, no matter the size.

## What is Git?

Git is a free, open-source version control system that was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. Git is designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. It is widely used by software developers all around the world.

## Installing Git

Before we can start using Git, we need to install it. Git is available for Windows, MacOS, and Linux. You can download Git from the official Git website. If you need some help, see [part one]({% post_url 2023-05-06-install-git %}) of this series. Once you have downloaded Git, follow the instructions to install it on your operating system.

## Creating a Git Repository

Now that we have Git installed, we can create a Git repository. A Git repository is a folder or directory where we will store our code and other files. To create a new Git repository, open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to create the repository. Then, type the following command:

```bash
git init
```

That's it, super simple but very powerful. This command initializes a new Git repository in the current directory. You can also see what git did when it initialized the directory by typing the following command:

```bash
ls -a
```

This command shows us all the hidden files and directories in the directory. The one we are interested in is the `.git` directory. This contains all of the version control metadata and object database for the repository.

## Adding Files to the Repository

Once we have a Git repository, we can start adding files to it. To add a file to the repository, we first need to create the file in the repository directory. Then, we use the following command to add the file to the Git repository:

```bash
git add filename
```

This command stages the file in the staging area for inclusion in the repository. We can use the following command to see the status of our repository:

```bash
git status
```

This command shows us which files are staged for inclusion in the repository and which files are not.

## Committing Changes

After adding files to the repository, we need to commit the changes to the repository. A commit is a snapshot of the repository at a particular point in time. To commit changes, use the following command:

```bash
git commit -m "commit message"
```

This command creates a new commit with the changes we have made. The commit message should briefly describe the changes we have made.

## Conclusion

In this article, we introduced you to Git and showed you how to get started with version control using Git. We covered the basics of creating a Git repository, adding files to the repository, and committing changes. With Git, you can collaborate with others on your code, track changes, and easily revert to previous versions if necessary. In the [next article]({% post_url 2023-05-09-collaborating-with-git %}) in this series, we'll cover more advanced Git topics, including branching and merging.
