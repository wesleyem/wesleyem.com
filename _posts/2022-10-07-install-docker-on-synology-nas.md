If you're interested in home lab work and creating a standardized unit of software that can quickly and reliably run on various computing environments, Docker is a great tool for you to explore. Here's how to install Docker on your Synology NAS:

## Step 1:

Sign into your Synology NAS and launch the Package Center. For most installations, Package Center is simply located on the desktop. In some cases, you might need to click on the 'Start' icon in the top left to open the application flyout. Package Manager will be among the applications listed.

## Step 2:

Once you have Package Manager launched, go to the search bar and type 'Docker' (without quotes) and click 'Install.' If you already have Docker installed, it will say 'Open' instead.
