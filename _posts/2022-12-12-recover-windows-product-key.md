If you've lost your Windows product key, don't worry, there are several methods you can use to recover it. Here are three different ways to find your Windows product key:

## Method 1: Command Prompt (CMD)

1. Press the Windows key and type CMD.
1. Right-click on the Command Prompt option and select "Run as administrator."
1. In the Command Prompt window, type:

```cmd
wmic path softwarelicensingservice get OA3xOriginalProductKey
```

1. The product key should be displayed on the screen. If it displays only "OA3xOriginalProductKey" and a blank line, you have a digital license. See Method 3.

## Method 2: PowerShell

1. Press the Windows key and type PowerShell.
1. Right-click on the PowerShell option and select "Run as administrator."
1. In the PowerShell window, type:

```powershell
(Get-WmiObject -query 'select * from SoftwareLicensingService').OA3xOriginalProductKey
```

1. The product key should be displayed on the screen. If it displays only `OA3xOriginalProductKey` and a blank line, you have a digital license. See Method 3.

## Method 3: NirSoft ProduKey

1. Open your favorite web browser and navigate to NirSoft's website.
1. Download the ProduKey program for 64-bit machines.
1. Unzip the downloaded file.
1. Launch the application and your product key will be visible.

By using one of these methods, you can quickly and easily recover your Windows product key, allowing you to reinstall or activate your operating system.
